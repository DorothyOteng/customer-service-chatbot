# Customer Service Chatbot

This project was created to gain hands-on experience with Generative AI technologies after completing a Generative AI course. The chatbot is designed to handle common customer service inquiries and is embedded into a web page using Chatbase integration.

## Project Description
The chatbot provides automated responses to frequently asked questions, such as business hours, order tracking, and return policies. The integration utilizes Chatbase's Generative AI capabilities and is hosted on GitHub Pages for public access.

## Live Demo
Access the live demo here (https://dorothyoteng.github.io/customer-service-chatbot/index.html).

## Features
- Answers 10+ common customer service questions using Chatbase's Generative AI.
- Embedded into a web page using pre-configured Chatbase tools.
- Deployed on GitHub Pages for public access.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Integrated Chatbase scripts into a static webpage.
- JavaScript: Handled the embedding and chatbot configuration.
- Chatbase: Configured chatbot responses and tested their accuracy.
- GitHub Pages: Hosted the chatbot for live deployment.

## Contributions
- Configured chatbot responses in Chatbase for 10+ common customer service inquiries, including order tracking, return policies, and account assistance.
- Integrated the chatbot into a webpage using Chatbase-provided scripts, HTML, and JavaScript.
- Tested the chatbotâ€™s responses to ensure accuracy and refined configurations via the Chatbase dashboard.
- Deployed the chatbot to GitHub Pages, ensuring public accessibility and usability.
Note: As Chatbase is a no-code platform, much of the chatbot logic was configured through its dashboard, not via custom scripts. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate, test, and deploy pre-built chatbot solutions.
